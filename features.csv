time_key_sélection;selection time in HHMMSS format;x
status_preceding_selection;status of the emergency vehicle prior to selection. An emergency vehicle is in various statuses during an intervention: Selection (selection of the emergency vehicle by the rescue commitment application) / Departed (the vehicle starts its route to the location of the emergency request) / Presented (the vehicle arrives at the location of the request) / Hospital transportation (the vehicle starts its transport of a victim to hospital) / Hospital arrival (the vehicle arrives at the hospital) / Returned (the vehicle has returned to its parking spot) / Leave the premises (because the vehicle can also simply leave the scene of an intervention without having to transport any victim) / Not available (for various reasons the vehicle can be in an unavailable position) / Not relevant (statutes without interest) ;x
